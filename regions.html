        <p class="card-text">The wine became popular outside France in the 1960s and 70s with a clever marketing ploy.
          The race to export the newly bottled wine was turned into an event which Le Figaro, dubbed "the greatest
          marketing stroke since the end of World War II". Bottles of Beaujolais have allegedly been transported around
          the world by elephant, Concorde and a hot-air balloon.
          This year the official launch of Beaujolais Nouveau Day will be held on November 21 in Tokyo to honour the
          faithful consumers. Japan imports a total of 25 per cent of all wine. The largest export market for Beaujolais
          wines is actually the United States.</p>

        <h5 class="card-title">Bordeaux</h5>
        <p class="card-text">Bordeaux is the most famous wine region in the world. While its illustrious wines are the
          most expensive globally, Bordeaux is more than just its price tag – it’s also full of history and quirky facts
          as well.
          There is nothing like the Bordeaux name to make English wine lovers tremble with excitement in anticipation of
          sipping its precious liquor. In fact, a fine bottle from the region can loosen up even the stiffest upper lip,
          with Bordeaux and England sharing a long and rich history.
          It all started in 1152, when Eleanor of Aquitaine married Henry Plantagenet, who became king of England in
          1154. The love affair continued for centuries and, like in every relationship, there were a few periods of ups
          and downs. Even though Bordeaux was given back to the French in 1453, its wines are still top of mind for
          English consumers.</p>

        <h5 class="card-title">Burgundy</h5>
        <p class="card-text">It’s the birthplace of Dijon mustard and if you happen to know that the capital of the
          Burgundy region is a city called Dijon, this may come as no surprise. Dijon mustard was first used in the 14th
          century, and became popular in 1856, when vinegar, one of the main ingredients in mustard, was replaced with
          verjus — the juice of unripe grapes — by Dijon painter Jean Naijon.

          It’s also the birthplace of the Eiffel Tower (sort of).
          The Eiffel Tower in Paris is one of the world’s most famous landmarks and tourist attractions, but its
          namesake wasn’t born in the City of Light. Gustave Eiffel was born in Dijon in 1832, and in 1879 founded the
          company that would design his namesake tower (Eiffel also contributed to the design of the Statue of Liberty).

        <h5 class="card-title">Languedoc-Rousillon</h5>
        <p class="card-text">In the 13th century, the process of mutage (adding spirit to wine must to stop fermentation
          and preserve sweetness) was invented in the Languedoc, hundreds of years before port wines were made. The
          sweet wines (vin doux naturel) of the Languedoc are some of the most delicious sweet wines in the
          world.Limoux. In the 16th century, sparkling wine was created by the monks near Limoux 150 years before Dom
          Perignon “tasted the stars” further north in the Champagne region of France. That was a happy day for the
          world of celebration worldwide! We love the bubbly wine from méthode ancestrale, and also the Blanquette de
          Limoux and Crémant de Limoux.</p>

        <h5 class="card-title">Loire Valley</h5>
        <p class="card-text">The Loire Valley lies to the South West of Paris and makes up the "Centre" region of France.
          The Loire, France's longest river (1,020 km) runs from the Massif Central to the Atlantic coast, and provides
          what many regard as a north-south climatic divide. The region was once France's royal and intellectual
          capital, and is extremely rich in both history and architecture. Picturesque villages alternate with towns
          rich in art and history, while Romanesque and Gothic styles dominate in the façades and decoration of the
          religious monuments. The Loire is lined with magnificent Châteaux which combine with the luxuriant landscape
          and fine food and wine to make the region one of the most attractive destinations in France. As France's intellectual capital in the 13th century, Orléans attracted artists, poets and troubadours to the
          Royal Court. </p>

        <p class="card-text">The most expensive rose wine in the world is produced in Provence. Made by Chateau
          D'Esclans, the makers of the world renowned Whispering Angel, a bottle of Garrus is the most pricey rose
          available. Selling for no less than $90 per bottle, this superb example of a rose wine is enjoyed throughout
          the world for its fresh, pure and delicate flavours, aroma and appearance. Provence is sunnier and hotter than
          Los Angeles and Miami. It may not sound plausible, but Provence actually benefits from an average of 2,900
          hours of sun per year, whereas the American locations are as little as 2,000 hours. With the excellent
          climate, Provence is a perfect destination for holidaymakers, outdoor enthusiasts and winemakers alike. The
          dry winds that are famous in Provence make excellent growing conditions for the hectares of grapes in the
          area.</p>
