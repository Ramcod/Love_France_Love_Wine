      <h2>What do I need to know about France?</h2>
      <hr>
      <ol>
        <li>Most visited country</li>
        <p>A whopping 89.3 million people visited the country in 2018, making it the most visited destination in the world. The country’s capital, Paris, is also the third most visited city in the world, behind Bangkok and London.</p>
        <li>We used to speak French!</li>
        <p>French was the official language of England between 1066 and 1362. But after William the Conqueror led the Norman conquest and subsequent occupation of England in 1066, he introduced Anglo-Norman French to the nation.</p>
        <li>Most expensive wine</li>
        <p>A 73-year-old bottle of French Burgundy became the most expensive bottle of wine ever sold at auction, fetching an eye-popping $558,000.</p>
        <li>Not so cheesy</li>
        <p>France produced around 1.7 million tons of cow’s milk cheese in 2018 alone. There are also around 1,600 distinct types of French cheese to try, which are grouped into eight categories. </p>
        <li>Gastronomy</li>
        <p>French gastronomy was awarded UNESCO World Heritage Status in 2010</p>

      <h2>What are some of the best things to eat in France?</h2>
      <hr>
      <ol>
        <li>Tartiflette</li>
        <p>It is made with potatoes, onions, lardons (bacon bits) and  Reblochon cheese from the Savoy region of France.</p>
        <li>Truffles</li>
          <p>Truffles are a type of fungus, like mushrooms, that occur naturally in wooded areas near oak trees. Popular dishes made with truffles include foie gras with truffles.</p>
        
        <li>Baguetttes</li>
          <p>There is a specific requirement that was legislated in 1993 that a baguette needs to be made on the premises where they are sold and can't be frozen or contain any additives or preservatives, containing 4 ingredients: wheat flour, water, salt and yeast.</p>
       
        <li>Snails, otherwise known as, escargots</li>
          <p>Some of the best snails in France come from the Burgundy region. Snails in France are served with rich parsley and garlic butter sauce.</p>
       
        <li>Steak Tartare</li>
          <p>Perhaps my favourite! It is raw meat which is finely chopped, by hand, and seasoned. Onions, capers, cornichons and a raw egg are added to complete the dish.</p>

      <h2>What are some of the best things to see, or do, in France?</h2>
      <hr>
      <ol>
        <li>Mont St-Michel, Normandy</li>
        <p>On the border between Brittany and Normandy lies the Abbaye du Mont Saint-Michel, a legendary abbey that brings the artistry of medieval architecture and the forces of nature together.</p>
        <li>Nîmes: Arenes de Nîmes</li>
        <p>Arguably the best preserved Roman amphitheater there is to be seen, this arena has been a dominant factor in the city of Nîmes for almost 2,000 years.</p>
        <li>Carcassonne Medieval City</li>
        <p>There are in fact two Carcassonnes: One is the famed walled city, and the other being the adjacent town which spreads out at its base (ville basse).</p>
        <li>Champagne-Ardenne: Champagne Route</li>
        <p>The Champagne Route takes its meandering path throughout the region’s adorable villages, diverse vineyards, and elegant champagne houses, where the owners patiently await the visitor to share in their passion.</p>
        <li>Orange: Theatre Antique d’Orange</li>
        <p>Built early on in the first century AD, the theater demonstrates such distinctive features that you’d be forgiven for thinking that this was a particularly well-staged contemporary perplexity.</p>
